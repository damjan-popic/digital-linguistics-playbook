## What this project does

This example shows a Microsoft Word add-in for reviewing Slovenian comma placement. The fork is configured with safety defaults: mock mode avoids sending document text out of the add-in, and remote services must be explicitly trusted or allowed.

## Use this when

- you want users to inspect a real language-technology application, not only scripts.
- you need a privacy-aware example of local vs remote processing.
- you want to discuss service configuration, manifests, tests, and build steps.
- you need a concrete case for Slovenian punctuation support in writing tools.

## What to inspect in the code

- `src/` — add-in source code.
- `docs/manifest.web.xml` and related manifests — Office add-in deployment.
- `.env.example` — safe configuration pattern.
- `tests/` — logic and service-configuration tests.
- `package.json` — scripts for build, validation, and internal testing.
- `proxy/` — optional service proxy logic.

## Minimal run path

```bash
npm install
npm run start:internal
```

This starts the add-in in safe mock mode. For production or remote service testing, configuration must be explicit.

## Practice use

Ask users to trace what happens to document text in mock mode and remote mode. They should identify the exact setting that permits text to leave the add-in and explain the privacy implications.

## Limits and cautions

- A language-checking add-in can process sensitive document text.
- Remote APIs must be treated as data processors, not invisible plumbing.
- Mock mode is safe for demonstrations but does not validate the quality of comma correction.
- Production deployment requires careful service, security, and user-consent review.
