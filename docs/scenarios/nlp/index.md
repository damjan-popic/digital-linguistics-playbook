# NLP

Small, reproducible workflows for text processing, linguistic annotation, named entities, embeddings, and Python-based NLP work.

## Python/NLP first steps

This path starts from zero: installing Python, creating a virtual environment, running a script, reading files, writing tables, and using CLASSLA on a small Slovene text.

Use **Python 3.12.x** for this path. Do not use Python 3.13 or higher for these exercises unless a specific project explicitly says it has been tested with that version.

-   **1. Install and check Python 3.12**

    Start here if the terminal cannot yet run Python reliably.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Install Python 3.12](install-python-312-for-nlp.md)

-   **2. Create one virtual environment per project**

    Keep packages isolated and make commands predictable.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Create a venv](create-a-python-312-virtual-environment.md)

-   **3. Install packages and record them**

    Use `python -m pip`, test imports, and keep `requirements.txt` useful.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Install with pip](install-python-packages-with-pip.md)

-   **4. Run scripts instead of clicking around**

    Learn the smallest repeatable script workflow.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Run a script](run-a-python-script-from-terminal.md)

-   **5. Process files and tables**

    Read text files, preserve UTF-8, and export CSV files with pandas.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Read text files](read-and-write-text-files-in-python.md)

-   **6. Annotate Slovene with CLASSLA**

    Install CLASSLA, test one sentence, annotate one file, then export token tables.

## Starter code

The repository includes a small runnable starter project:

```text
examples/python-nlp-first-steps/
```

It contains sample data, scripts, and a `requirements.txt` for the Python and CLASSLA workflows above. Use it as a reference structure, not as a magic folder. Recreate the steps manually at least once before copying the whole example.
