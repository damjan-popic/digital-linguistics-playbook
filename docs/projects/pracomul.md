# Dialogue corpus tabulation and lexical-diversity analysis

## What this project does

This example turns an SLC-style dialogue-corpus export into tidy data frames and precomputed aggregate tables. It recognizes speaker turns, normalizes transcription artefacts, attaches speaker metadata, computes lexical-diversity and sentence-level diagnostics, and exports CSV outputs.

## Use this when

- you have conversational corpus data and need analysis-ready tables.
- you want to teach corpus grain: document, speaker, turn, token, aggregate.
- you need an example of lexical-diversity metrics in practice.
- you want users to see why a data dictionary matters.

## What to inspect in the code

- `analyze_slc.py` — the main pipeline script.
- `data/` — input corpus material.
- `results/` — output tables.
- `slc_column_dictionary.xlsx` — column dictionary.
- notebooks — exploratory analysis and checks.

## Minimal run path

```bash
python analyze_slc.py data/corpus.txt results
```

Expected outputs include token tables, turn tables, speaker-centered tables, aggregate summaries, and lexical-diversity measures.

## Practice use

Ask users to draw the data model: corpus → document → speaker → turn → token → aggregate. Then have them decide which research questions require each level.

## Limits and cautions

- Dialogue transcription conventions shape the output.
- Sentence boundaries in conversational data are approximate.
- Lexical-diversity metrics are sensitive to text length and preprocessing.
- Original transcripts may have non-commercial or restricted-use licensing.
