## What this project does

This example analyses interview transcripts split into user and AI sections. It produces token-level output, section summaries, lemma summaries, transcript summaries, and optional CoNLL-U exports.

## Use this when

- you need to compare user and assistant language in structured transcripts.
- you want to process transcript sections separately.
- you need token-level and summary-level outputs from the same workflow.
- you want a compact example of Stanza-based transcript annotation.

## What to inspect in the code

- `scripts/` — processing scripts.
- `interview_split.tsv` — expected input structure.
- `interview_transcripts/` — transcript material; check sensitivity before reuse.
- `stanza_out/` — generated annotation outputs.
- `analysis/` — downstream summaries or analysis outputs.
- README command examples for choosing user, assistant, or both sections.

## Minimal run path

```bash
python -m pip install -U stanza pandas tqdm pyarrow openpyxl
python stanza_tag_sections.py \
  --input interview_split.tsv \
  --outdir stanza_out \
  --which both \
  --extra csv
```

Optional flag:

```bash
--conllu
```

- [How do I package a corpus with FAIR metadata?](../scenarios/publishing/package-a-corpus-with-fair-metadata.md)

## Practice use

Give users a tiny TSV with one transcript and two sections: `u_*` and `a_*`. Ask them to compute one section-level metric and one lemma-level summary, then explain what cannot be inferred from those metrics alone.

## Limits and cautions

- Interview transcripts can contain personal or sensitive data.
- Section labels must be consistent before annotation.
- Token-level annotation quality depends on language, model, and transcript cleanliness.
- Quantitative summaries should be paired with qualitative reading.
