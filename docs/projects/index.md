# Code examples

These pages describe public repositories by **function**, not by repository nickname. The goal is to help readers move from a workflow to working code quickly: what the code does, which files to inspect, how to run a minimal example, what output to expect, and what limits matter.

## Why some public repositories are not listed

A repository is included here only when its public README or visible file structure makes its function clear enough to describe responsibly. Repositories without a public description, minimal run path, or clear reusable workflow are better left out of the production-facing catalogue until they are documented.

## Reuse checklist

Before featuring or reusing a repository publicly, check:

- the README explains the purpose and the minimal command.
- dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, or similar.
- sample data is legal to publish.
- large or generated data is not accidentally committed.
- private credentials, tokens, PDFs, transcripts, or local paths are not exposed.
- expected outputs are named.
- failure modes are documented.
- license and citation expectations are clear.
