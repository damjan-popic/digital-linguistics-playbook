## What you are trying to do

You need a small focused corpus from one public website.

!!! quote "One-sentence version"
    Start with a tiny sample, keep provenance, and only scale up once the workflow survives testing.

## You need

- Seed URL list
- Scope rules: what to include and exclude

## Tools

- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org)
- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- [readability-lxml](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability)

## Workflow

1. Check site terms, robots.txt, and ethical constraints.
2. Create a small seed list.
3. Download slowly and politely.
4. Extract main text, not navigation or cookie banners.
5. Save each page with URL, date, and metadata.

## Output

Folder of clean `.txt` files plus metadata.

## Check yourself

- Can each text be traced back to a URL?
- Did you remove menus and boilerplate?
- Is the scope narrow enough to describe?

## Common traps

- Scraping too much too fast.
- Publishing copyrighted text without permission.
- Losing provenance.

## Practice task

Students scrape nothing at first: they design the collection policy and metadata sheet before any download.

## Useful extension

Turn the workflow into a small reusable checklist: input, command or tool action, output, quality check, and known failure mode.
